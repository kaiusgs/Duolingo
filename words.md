I'd like to talk about

The kid in the neighborhood kept shouting and running in the midnight.

I worked my tail off. 我拼命工作   
I was worn out. 我累坏了  
I never got a change to relax and unwind. 没有机会休息  
I wish I could go on a vacation in Hawaii, lying on the beach, touching the soft sand and feeling the salty breeze  
It would be a fantastic escape from a hustle and bustle of the urban life.  

I had a tight schedule and I stayed up late frequently. 我经常熬夜  
I had a mountain piles of homework and I kept doing it day in and day out.  
I told my mom I went to school but I sneaked out of the class and wandered around on the street.   
I lost the awareness of time elapse and I didn't notice it was time to go back until the sun went down behind the mountains.  
The reason why I lied is I need a temporary escape badly.    

release my pressure
