# A Letter to Mike
Dear Mike:  
&emsp;&emsp;I'm writing to ask a favor of you. Currently, engaged in exploring American customs, I'm in urgent need of original books concerning this topic, which are, however, unavailable in China. Consequently, I'm encountering trouble going further. Could you please purchase some for me?  
&emsp;&emsp;Actually, five or six books would be sufficient to offer me an full perspective of American customs, presenting their backgroud, origins, influence on people and society, and various specifics concerned.  
&emsp;&emsp;I'd appreciate it if you counld get them delivered to me in a fortnight, by January 18th, at your convinience. The money will be transfered to your account. I hope that I'm not putting you to too much touble. My gratitude is simply beyond words.  
&emsp;&emsp;Looking forward to your generous reply!

# Global Warming 
&emsp;&emsp;
Global warming is causing significant and concerninig changes to our planet's climate, leading to a multitude of negative consequences.These include:   
&emsp;&emsp;
Rising tempaeratures: Earth's average temprature has increased significantly over the last century because of human activity. This rise in temperature has led to more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and wildfires.  
&emsp;&emsp;
Melting ice caps: Due to glabal warming, the ice caps in both the Arctic and Antarctic are melting at unprecedented rates. This is causing sea levels to rise rapidly, which poses a threat to coastal cities worldwide.  
&emsp;&emsp;
Extreme weather conditions: Global waiming contributes significantly to extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes. These natural disasters often cause life-thretening situations for people living in their path.  

# A Letter to Joe
Dear Joe:  
&emsp;&emsp;How's everything going? I'm writing to talk about financial sources of college students, which are quite different in China and in America. According to a survay, merely 45% of American students' financial support is acquired from parents, while Chinese parents provide approximately 90%. Meanwhile, American students' part-time jobs and scholarships earn up to 55% for them, compared to a mere 10% percent for their Chinese counterparts.  
&emsp;&emsp;Evidently, it's an alarming message that this sharp contrast conveys. Without doubt, America lays remarkable emphasis on self-reliance development, with students' flexible schedule making part-time job opportunities accessible to them. In contrast, Chinese parents' financial support is simply taken for granted.  
&emsp;&emsp;Nevertheless, government conscious of this, our current education system is reforming itself, seeking to create more approaches to promoting students' independence. Hopefully, the near future will witness an increase of the percentage of Chinese students' self-earned financial support.  
&emsp;&emsp;What's your idea? Looking forward to your reply!
