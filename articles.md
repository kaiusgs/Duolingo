## A Letter to David
Dear David,  
&emsp;&emsp;
I'm writing to express my sincerest gratitude to you for inviting me to the summer camp launched by your school. However, it's a great pity that I won't be available to attend it.  
&emsp;&emsp; 
Actually, this approaching summer will witness me being extremely occupied working on college application. Choosing a favorate major in a suitable university is of vital importance, which will, after all, make an almost decisive difference to my future career. Consequently, I can't make it to America.  
&emsp;&emsp;
Frankly, always longing to attend an American summer camp, I can't be more sorry to miss it. I do hope that I'll be blessed with another oppotunity later.   
<div style='text-align:right;margin-top:-16pix;'>Yours:</div>

## A Letter to Mike
Dear Mike:  
&emsp;&emsp;I'm writing to ask a favor of you. Currently, engaged in exploring American customs, I'm in urgent need of original books concerning this topic, which are, however, unavailable in China. Consequently, I'm encountering trouble going further. Could you please purchase some for me?  
&emsp;&emsp;Actually, five or six books would be sufficient to offer me an full perspective of American customs, presenting their backgroud, origins, influence on people and society, and various specifics concerned.  
&emsp;&emsp;I'd appreciate it if you counld get them delivered to me in a fortnight, by January 18th, at your convinience. The money will be transfered to your account. I hope that I'm not putting you to too much touble. My gratitude is simply beyond words.

## A Letter to Tom
Dear Tom:  
&emsp;&emsp;
As the winter vacation is around the corner, my parents and I can't wait to enjoy our Spring Festival holidays in New York. Therefore, I'm writing to ask you for a favor.  
&emsp;&emsp;
To start with, for the sake of convenience, could you please rent a downtown apartment capable of offering us half a month's accommodating? I'd appreciate it if the housing rent is reasonable, not too high. Furthermore, planning to tour the city, we'd like your guidance as to what attractions to explore. Also, not accustomed to western food, we have no alternative but to enquire you about the restaurants in the neighborhood, where Chinese food is available. We can't do without your guidence, I'm afraid.  
&emsp;&emsp;
Earnestly awaiting your generous reply. Best wished!  
<div style='text-align:right;margin-top:-16px;'>Yours sincerely:</div>

## A Letter to Joe
Dear Joe:  
&emsp;&emsp;How's everything going? I'm writing to talk about financial sources of college students, which are quite different in China and in America. According to a survey, merely 45% of American students' financial support is acquired from parents, while Chinese parents provide approximately 90%. Meanwhile, American students' part-time jobs and scholarships earn up to 55% for them, compared to a mere 10% percent for their Chinese counterparts.  
&emsp;&emsp;Evidently, it's an alarming message that this sharp contrast conveys. Without doubt, America lays remarkable emphasis on self-reliance development, with students' flexible schedule making part-time job opportunities accessible to them. In contrast, Chinese parents' financial support is simply taken for granted.  
&emsp;&emsp;Nevertheless, government conscious of this, our current education system is reforming itself, seeking to create more approaches to promoting students' independence. Hopefully, the near future will witness an increase of the percentage of Chinese students' self-earned financial support.  
&emsp;&emsp;What's your idea? Looking forward to your reply!  
<div style='text-align:right;margin-top:-16px;'>Your's:</div>

## Foreign Language
> When should children begin learning a foreign language? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.   

__It is incontrovertible that__ foreign language acquisition should __commence__ at the earlies possible __juncture__, ideally before the age of 5.

__The primary impetus for this perspective steems from__ the extraordinary neuroplasticity of young children's brains, enabling them to rapidly __assimilate__ new linguistic systems. The ealier the exposure to a second language, the more effortless they can attain native-like phonological proficiency and internalize he languages grammatical intricacies. 

Consider, for instance, scholarly research demonstrating that children __embarking on__ language learning before the age of 7 __exhibit a significantly higher propensity for__ achieving advanced proficiency compared to those initiating their studies as adolescents or adults. 

Hence, initiating foreign language education during the early childhood years __offers the most propitious path to__ attaining fluency.

> What would you say to those who argue that early childhood foreign language education __detracts from__ other crucial areas of learning and development? 

__Though there are those who advocate for__ postponing foreign language education to prevent hindering crucial development, __my conviction lies firmly in the notion that__ early language learning enhances overall congnitive faculties. 

This belief originates primarily from the heightend neuroplasticity and capacity of the yound brain to simultaneously acquire multiple languages during the formative years. __A partitcular salient example of this is__ the resounding success of immersion programs, which __conclusively demonstrate__ that children possess the ability to learn languages while __concurrently__ thriving in other academic disciplines.

## Migration
> When people move to a new country, they should follow the customs of the new country rather than the customs of their home country. Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.  

As the saying goes: 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do'. Migration is a common phenomenon in today's globalized world. People move to new countries for various reasons such as job opportunities, education, or seeking a better lifestyle.

One of the essential aspects of adapting to a new country is learning the local language. Mastering the language helps immigrants communicate with locals, understand the customs and traditions, and ultimately integrate into society. Moreover, speaking the native language is a sign of respect towards the host country, demonstrating a willingness to assimilate and contribute to the community.

Adapting to new customs does not mean abandoning one's cultural identity. On the contrary, it involves embracing the cultural exchange that takes place between the host country and one's home country. This exchange enriches both cultures, leading to a more diverse and tolerant society. By respecting and understanding the customs of their new country,immigrants can foster a sense of belonging and contribute to cultural diversity.
